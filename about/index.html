<p>Thank you for visiting my blog! This page describes a bit about me and the site.</p>
<h3>Who <small>am I?</small></h3>
<p>
My name is Talon Daniels. I am studying Computer Science and I program things in my spare time.
I mostly use Java, but sometimes I will use C# or Python. I'm currently learning Ruby and Rails, but that's low on my priority list.
I'm fairly lazy, but this is a good thing. It means that I like to have things as automated as possible.
Sometimes this can hinder productivity as I spend more time getting something automated than it would have taken to just do it myself.
I don't view this as a bad thing though because I am more likely to do the task in the future now that it's automated. I also tend to learn
something new along the way.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy most things that are related to technology and I like getting them to work together in interesting ways.
I try to keep up to date on everything, but this can be challenging as I explore new topics.
Lately, I've been getting more involved with front-end/web development,
whereas in the past I focused more on desktop applications (though this is still my favorite, probably).
</p>

<h3>What <small>is the blog about?</small></h3>
<p>This blog will be my central hub for communicating and sharing my ideas, creations, and discoveries.
The range of topics doesn't necessarily have a scope, though most posts will be technology related.
Posts will range in topic. Some posts could include an amusing link I found, tools that I use, and updates to a project I'm working on.
Or posts could be completely unrelated, ranging from pictures I take to thoughts on just about anything.</p>
<p>Another thing that you'll find on this blog are tutorials for a range of topics. I don't claim to be an expert on any
of these subjects, but I usually know enough to get things working how I want. The tutorials you find may be geared for any
level of experience, though most of them will be slightly above <i>Hello World</i> difficulty.</p>
<hr>
<h3>When <small>is the blog updated?</small></h3>
<p>It's still just the beginning of this blog, but I am going to try to post at least once a week.
At the very least, I will post once a month.
If I start to get more readers, I may post more often though.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Where <small>am I?</small></h3>
<p>Depending on the time of the year, I reside in either Bozeman, MT where I attend school, or Helena, MT where I work during the summer.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why <small>does this blog exist?</small></h3>
<p>There are a few reasons this blog exists. One of the main reasons is I enjoy sharing information, but Facebook and Twitter weren't well-suited for this purpose.
Having a blog allows me to write longer posts with more details. Another reason this blog exists is it provides a central hub of everything
that I am working on, or have worked on. It will provide a well-organized collection of my projects and other miscellaneous things I feel like sharing.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I enjoy sharing information. This will be done through posting tutorials. The tutorials serve a dual purpose.
One purpose is to convey my knowledge about a particular subject to the reader so that they can expand their knowledge on that subject.
The other purpose is mostly for me, as writing the tutorials reinforces my knowledge on the subject. They also serve as a quick reference for
myself, so that in case I forget how to do something in a certain way, I can look it up in one of my tutorials.</p>

<h3>How <small>is this blog put together?</small></h3>
<p>Magic. No, but seriously, it is pretty neat. If you examine the page source, you'll notice that it's a (mostly) static site.
You might think to yourself that it's a maintenance nightmare, but it's actually quite the opposite. Adding a new post is as simple as
dropping a file in a folder and committing the change. You can view the source <a href="http://github.com/Talon876/talon876.github.com">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This is made possible by <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, which you can read more about in <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/statuses/my-blogs-new-home/">this post</a>.</p>
