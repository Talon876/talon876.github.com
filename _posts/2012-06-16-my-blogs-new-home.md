I'm trying to consolidate as many of my online profiles as I can.
I recently discovered [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), which will allow me to stop using Tumblr to host my blog.
Jekyll was developed by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/), one of the co-founders of GitHub.

####Jekyll overiew:
<br>
> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project's page or blog right here from GitHub.

I won't go in the details of Jekyll here, as you can find a bunch of information about it elsewhere. However, I will mention [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), as it was what convinced me to switch. It makes everything extremely easy and only took a few hours of tinkering with config files to get an understanding of how it was structured.

I've been spending the last several days working on the design of my site (and since I'm not a designer, that means stealing pieces of CSS from other sites **;)**). Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with how it's turned out so far and will probably make small tweaks to it in the future. The great thing about jekyll is it's really easy to change something in one place and have that change affect the whole site, which makes for great maintainability.

####Why I like Jekyll
*  Easy to use and maintain
*  Fast, since it generates a static site
*  I don't have to maintain a database
*  I can host my blog on GitHub
*  It's what I've been seeking for awhile, but didn't know what to look for

####You should check out Jekyll if
*  You want to create a small 'static' site that's easy to add content to
*  You like the idea of managing a blog with source control (e.g. Git)
*  You aren't afraid of text editors
*  You aren't worried about Mr. Hyde ;)
