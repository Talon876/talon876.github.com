###Hello there!

I just got a triple monitor mount hooked up yesterday and I wanted to share. 
In case you're wondering, it was the [Deluxe Triple Monitor Stand Free Standing up to 28"](http://shop.easymountlcd.com/Deluxe-Triple-Monitor-Stand-Free-Standing-up-to-28-002-0020-002-0020.htm) from EasyMountLCD. 

I'll admit that I was skeptical at first due to the vague product information and how cheap it was, considering most triple monitor stands are $250+ and this one was less than $100. I decided to just go for it, which was risky because I was also going to have to mount a 30" monitor on it when it claims to only support 28". However, it ended up working great and turned out to be a solid stand, and for the price it was well worth it.

My only complaint is I can't angle the side monitors in any more than what's shown. But I'm also using a 30" monitor instead of 28" so I imagine you could get a bit more angle with triple 24" or something similar. Oh and you'd have to be some sort of wizard to hook it up by yourself (it tries to fall over when only one side monitor is mounted).

Enough with text, pictures!
