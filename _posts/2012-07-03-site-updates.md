If you haven't noticed, I've made a few changes to the site lately.

I've redesigned the favicon ( <a href="/favicon.ico"><img class="noborder" src="/favicon.ico"/></a> ),
along with a new badge/logo which replaced the old "Nolat" link in the navbar. If you look closely, you will also notice that the background and content area
of the site have had subtle textures applied to them. They definitely give the website a nice "feel."

Additionally, I've modified the navbar to have dropdown boxes and added a few more options to the Contact Me link.
The Quick Message method is pretty cool, I made it myself. Filling out the form that appears will alert me via email (or a text message if I enable it).
So what's the point of using it if it just emails me? Well, you don't have to tell me who you are if you don't want to. Other than that, it was mostly just
an experiment of my own to see if I could even make it.

Lastly, you will notice the tagline at the far right of the navbar may be different than what you've seen before. It now changes on every page refresh. I'll try to add new messages to this
every time I submit a new post.
