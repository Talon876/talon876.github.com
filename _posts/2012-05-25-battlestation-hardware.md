{% include JB/setup %}
I just recently bought a new computer and thought I'd share its specs. And while I was doing that, I figured why not include the rest of my setup?

I decided to downgrade the size of the case, relative to what I've owned previously. There are a couple of reasons for this. One reason was I didn't necessarily have to sacrifice performance to drop from a full-tower case to a mini-tower case. The second reason is I've been playing video games less and don't really need a top of the line graphics card which is usually the reason to have a full tower case in the first place.

As you will see in the pictures though, even with a micro atx tower case, I can still fit a full sized graphics card in there. However, I was originally looking at mini-ITX motherboards and even smaller cases but there wasn't any mini-ITX motherboards supporting more than 8gb of RAM at the time.
